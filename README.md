## Search Functionality

### Graveyard Section Search

The app allows users to search for graves within specific sections of the graveyard. Users can select a graveyard section from a dropdown menu, and the app will display a list of graves within that section. This is particularly useful for those who know the section but not the exact location of a grave.

### Khundi-wise Search

Users can search for graves within specific Khundi sections. By selecting a Khundi from the provided options, the app will filter the results to display only those graves located within the selected Khundi. This feature is ideal for narrowing down searches within larger sections of the graveyard.

### Name-wise Search

For those who know the name of the deceased, the app offers a name-wise search feature. Users can enter a name into the search bar, and the app will display all graves that match the entered name, regardless of the section or Khundi.

### Combined Filtering

Users can also combine the search criteria to narrow down results further. For example, users can filter graves by both name and Khundi, or by name and graveyard section, making it easier to find specific graves within the large database.
