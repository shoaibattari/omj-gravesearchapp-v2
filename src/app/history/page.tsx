          Memon is a courageous and unique position holder mercantile
            community. It participates actively in all the social activities
            such as health, education, and cultural programs. When the forefathers of
            this community embraced Islam, they were named as &ldquo;Momin&rdquo;,
            and with the passage of time, they are now known as &ldquo;Memon&rdquo;. The
            conversion of the religion resulted in a lot of calamities, which
            were faced with utmost courage, and boldness to overcome. They had to
            migrate from their homeland. God accepted these trials for the sake of Islam
            and He bestowed blessings and such high
            capabilities that the Memon community is prominent in all walks of
            modern life. On the occasion of the presentation of history of the early
            period of the community, we are highly thankful to God that we are
            part and parcel of this community.

          The Memon community is a distinguished and courageous mercantile
            group known for its active participation in social activities,
            including health, education, and cultural programs. Their roots
            trace back to the Hindu Lohana caste, which converted to Islam in
            the early 15th century. Initially called &ldquo;Momin&rdquo;, they later became
            known as &ldquo;Memon&rdquo;. Despite facing numerous challenges and having to
            migrate, the Memons have thrived and become prominent in various
            fields of modern life.

          </h2>
          <p className="text-gray-700 md:px-6">
            The conversion to Islam by the Memon forefathers took place in
            1424-25 A.D. (824 Hijri) under the influence of Hazrat Yousufuddin
            Qadri, who settled in Thatta, Sindh. The local rulers and several
            prominent families, including the Sardars Seth Sundarji and Seth
            Hunsraj, embraced Islam, leading to the conversion of approximately
            700 families from the Lohana Hindu caste. This significant event
            marked the beginning of the Memon community.

          </h2>
          <p className="text-gray-700 md:px-6">
            The conversion led to social ostracism and economic hardships. Hindu
            families severed ties with the newly converted Muslims, prompting
            many Memons to migrate. Under the guidance of Hazrat Qadri, they
            first relocated to Waryah and later, due to severe conditions, moved
            to Halar Pargana of Kathiawar (Gujarat). A small group, known as the
            Kayaya families, remained in Waryah until 947 Hijri.
